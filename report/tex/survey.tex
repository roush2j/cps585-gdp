Time series forecasting is a topic discussed in any applied statistics course, 
primarily for its effective applications with economic time series data.  Most 
time series models are derived from the general 
autoregressive (AR) model. The choice of a Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) 
model for forecasting GDP is primarily influenced by
the textbook by Brooks \cite{brooks}, which discusses economic forecasting and 
its applications for modeling with economic and financial data. 
Giordano et al. use a VAR model to study the effect of the fiscal policies of
the Italian government \cite{giordano}.
Dungey \& Pagan use a VAR(11) model to predict market behavior
in Australia \cite{dungey}.  

The model described in this paper is a basic example of such models.

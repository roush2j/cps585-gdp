== data sources ==
-   Fed. Reserve bank of St. Louis (https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2)

== variables ==
*   real US GDP
-   total US capacity utilization
-   Interest rate on 3-month US treasury bills

-   Outstanding mortgage debt
-   Consumer Debt
-   civilian labor force participation
*   purchasing manager index (https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/NAPM)

*   real personal income
*   total non-farm employment
-   industrial productivity
-   real retail sales

*   Real Personal Consumption Expenditure
*   Government Consumption Expenditure
*   Gross Private Domestic Investment

== analysis ==
-   look at cross correlations to choose variables
    "forward selection", "backward selection"
-   vector autoregression (linear):
    Look at PMI and rGDP
    Model is d/dt(log(PMI)) and d/dt(log(rGDP))  OR d/dt.log of PCE,GCE,RPI
        Perform augmented dicky-fuller test to establish stationary
        Use partial autocorrelation function to find # of lags to use
        Also Akaike Information Criterion
-   neural network forcasting (http://neural-forecasting.com/)
    training indicators -> gdp works well for any given quarter
    prediction (past indicators -> current gdp) is much tougher
    
== results ==
-   Predicted rGDP in the future given the data up to the "present"
    A measure of the correctness of this prediction over the last 30 years
    Confidence bounds

\begin{frame}{GDP}
    \emph{Gross Domestic Product} measures the value of all goods and
    services produced in a country in a fixed period.    
    \[GDP = consumption + investment + (exports - imports)\]        
    Consumption and investment are further divided between private
    interests and government activities.
    
    \emph{Real GDP} corrects for inflation (measured independently) to make
    GDP comparable from year to year.
